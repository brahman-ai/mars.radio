                <p>Welcome to Mars Radio ! We are SO excited for you to be here.</p>
                <p>Welcome to Mars Radio Cyber Arts Camp. We are very excited to have you join us. From now on we’ll be calling you Martians. Today we will get you oriented on the tools we’ll be using and have you get started on the first steps to building your very own solar powered light sculpture. </p>
                <p>Everyday on Mars begins with a clean workspace. To achieve this, remove all clutter besides the supplies you will need for the days mission. </p>
                <p>The website is divided into 4 sections</p>
                <ul>

As a new Martian, we are excited to learn about your unique home planet. What is it called ? What does it look like ? Think about its characteristics ~ What is the topography like ? Describe the demographics, ecosystem, culture, flora, fauna, and beyond. Are there beings that walk its surface ? Is it solid ? Tell us story about it’s origin. These are only a suggested handful of ways to begin describing your planet, with many many more that I encourage you to explore. Let your imagination grow with the limitless possibilities of planetary creation. Write down your story.</p>
