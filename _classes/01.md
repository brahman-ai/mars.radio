Think about its characteristics ~ What is the topography like ? Describe the demographics, ecosystem, culture, flora, fauna, and beyond. Are there beings that walk its surface ? Is it solid ? Tell us story about itâ€™s origin. These are only a suggested handful of ways to begin describing your planet, with many many more that I encourage you to explore. Let your imagination grow with the limitless possibilities of planetary creation. Write down your story.</p>
