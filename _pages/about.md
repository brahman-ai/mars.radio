                <p>New hands-on virtual course teaches anyone (young or old) how to design and code their very own solar powered light sculpture from scratch. </p>
                <h2><span>Introducing</span><br/><strong>Mars Radio: Cyber Arts Course</strong></h2>
                <p>The 2020 pandemic has affected all of us. One of the biggest changes is the shut down of many (daily) activities we once enjoyed.. including sports, classes, and more. Both adults and kids are stuck at home looking to fill their days with activities that don’t revolve around staring at another screen. </p>
                <p>We designed this high-tech arts course to give you a hands on project that you can be proud of. A self sustained solar powered art sculpture that you’ll design with your own style. We will send you a complete tool kit that you’ll need to construct your project.  In addition to the tools we will also give you access to our entertaining (8 episode) training videos with step by step instructions. On top of all this we’ll give you support from one of our coaches.</p>
